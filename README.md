# Expo CLI Development Server Failure: Missing Module Error

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with the Expo CLI, where the development server fails to start due to a reported missing module: `expo-cli/build/cli`. The issue seems to be related to a mismatch in versions or corrupted installation post-system update. This repo includes both the problematic code (minimal) and a solution to resolve the issue.

## Bug Report

The bug manifests as a failure to start the development server, with the error message: `Error: Cannot find module 'expo-cli/build/cli'` appearing in the console.  Standard troubleshooting steps (reinstalling Expo CLI, clearing caches, restarting the system) did not resolve the issue.

## Solution

The solution involves a thorough reinstallation process, specifically focusing on removing potentially conflicting or corrupted Expo CLI installations.

1. **Complete uninstall:** Ensure that you uninstall Expo CLI completely, using npm or yarn depending on your package manager. You may need to manually remove any related files from your node_modules. 
2. **Clear npm and yarn cache:** Clean the caches of both npm and yarn using `npm cache clean --force` and `yarn cache clean`. 
3. **Reinstall Expo CLI:** After cleaning the cache, reinstall expo CLI using your preferred method (npm or yarn).
4. **Verify Installation:** Run `expo --version` to verify the correct installation of the latest Expo CLI version.
5. **Restart Project:** After reinstalling, restart your Expo development server.

This solution focuses on eliminating potential conflicts and ensures a clean Expo CLI environment, thereby resolving the `'expo-cli/build/cli'` module error.
