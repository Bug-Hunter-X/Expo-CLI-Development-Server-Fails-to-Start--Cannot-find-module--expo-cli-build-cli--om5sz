While working with Expo CLI, I encountered an unusual error where the development server wouldn't start, and I was getting an error message related to a missing or invalid configuration. I tried several things to resolve this, but none worked. Specifically, the error I saw in the console was: `Error: Cannot find module 'expo-cli/build/cli'`, despite having expo-cli installed and updated.  My project was a simple React Native app using Expo managed workflow. The error appeared after a recent system update.
